The police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Here's the story of a lovely lady, who was bringing up three very lovely girls. All of them had hair of gold, like their mother, the youngest one in curls. Here's the store, of a man named Brady, who was busy with three boys of his own. They were four men, living all together, yet they were all alone. 'Til the one day when the lady met this fellow. And they knew it was much more than a hunch, that this group would somehow form a family. That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch, the Brady Bunch. That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch. The Brady Bunch! When Captain America throws his mighty shield, all those who chose to oppose his shield must yield! If he's led to a fight and a duel is due, then the red and the white and the blue'll come through! When Captain America throws his mighty shield!"
